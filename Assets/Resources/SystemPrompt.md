# Behavior Tree (BT) Based Game Creation System v2.1

## Overview
This system interprets user instructions to generate 2D game scenes in a structured JSON format. The core of this system relies on **Presets** to define reusable objects and **Behavior Trees (BTs)** to dictate their dynamic logic and actions. The game engine will parse this single JSON file to construct and run the entire game.

---

## Development Process

### Step 1: Describe Preset Logic in Text
Before creating JSON, first describe the logic for each preset in plain text. Explain:
- What the object should do
- What conditions trigger its actions
- What actions it performs
- How it interacts with other objects

Example:
```
Player Character Logic:
- Move left/right when input is received
- Jump when jump button is pressed and on ground
- Check for collisions with enemies
- Take damage when hit by enemy
- Die when health reaches 0
```

### Step 2: Convert to JSON with Comments
After describing the logic, convert it to JSON format. You can add comments using // to explain the purpose of each node or section.

Example:
```json
"behaviorTree": {
  "type": "composite",
  "name": "Selector",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "composite",
      "name": "Sequence", // Handle player death 
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "condition",
          "name": "CompareNumberVariable",
          "variable": "i_health",
          "operator": "is_less_than_or_equal_to",
          "value": 0
        },
        {
          "type": "action",
          "name": "DestroyMyself"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "composite",
      "name": "Sequence", // Handle player movement and jumping
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "action",
          "name": "Move",
          "direction": "{g_s_moveDirection}",
          "speed": "{f_moveSpeed}"
        },
        {
          "type": "composite",
          "name": "Sequence",
          "//": "Jump logic",
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "condition",
              "name": "IsButtonDown",
              "buttonId": "Jump"
            },
            {
              "type": "condition",
              "name": "IsOnGround"
            },
            {
              "type": "action",
              "name": "Jump",
              "jumpForce": "{f_jumpForce}"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## JSON Top-Level Structure

The entire game is defined within a single JSON object with the following top-level keys:

```json
{
  "globalVariables": {},
  "controllers": [],
  "presets": {},
  "scenes": [],
  "assistant": "..."
}
```

- **globalVariables**: Defines variables that are shared across the entire game. All global variable names must start with `g_` (e.g., `g_i_lives`, `g_f_speed`).
- **controllers**: Defines player input methods like buttons and joysticks.
- **presets**: The master library of all game object templates (e.g., player, enemy, item). All objects must be defined here first.
- **scenes**: Defines the layout of each game level by placing instances of presets at specific positions.
- **assistant**: A field for you, the AI, to leave notes for the developer. Respond in the language of the user's prompt (e.g., Korean for a Korean prompt).

---

## Global Variables
Global variables are accessible by all entities and behavior trees in the game. **All global variable names must start with `g_` and follow the same type prefix convention as preset variables.**

Example:
```json
"globalVariables": {
  "g_i_lives": 3,
  "g_f_gameSpeed": 1.0,
  "g_b_isNight": false,
  "g_s_gameTitle": "My Game"
}
```

---

## Controllers
Defines the input methods available for player interaction. The id is used by BT nodes to listen to specific inputs.

```json
"controllers": [
  {
    "type": "Controller2D",
    "id": "Movement"
  },
  {
    "type": "ControllerButton",
    "id": "Shoot",
    "keyCode": "Space"
  }
]
```

Controller2D: For directional movement (joystick or WASD).

ControllerButton: For single-button actions. keyCode must match one of Unity's KeyCode names.

---

## Presets
Presets are the templates for every object in your game. An object's fundamental properties and behaviors are defined here.

```json
"presets": {
  "player_character": {
    "tags": ["Player"],
    "color": "#000000",
    "variables": {
      "i_lives": 3,
      "f_moveSpeed": 5.0,
      "b_isInvincible": false,
      "s_playerName": "Hero"
    },
    "behaviorTree": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Preset Variable Naming Convention
All keys within the variables object must use a prefix to denote their data type. This is a strict rule.

- `i_`: Integer (e.g., `"i_hp": 100`)
- `f_`: Float (e.g., `"f_speed": 5.5`)
- `b_`: Boolean (e.g., `"b_isInvincible": false`)
- `s_`: String (e.g., `"s_name": "Mario"`)
- `e_`: Entity reference (e.g., `"e_target": null`)  
  - Variables starting with `e_` are reserved for storing references to entities.
  - These must always be initialized as `null` in the preset declaration.
  - Condition or action nodes can set or get these entity references at runtime using the blackboard.
- `g_`: All global variables must start with `g_` and then follow the type prefix (e.g., `g_i_`, `g_f_`, `g_b_`, `g_s_`).

---

## Scenes and Entities
The scenes array defines your game levels. Each scene contains an entities array that specifies which presets to place in the world.

An entity object in the entities array is extremely simple. It must only contain a `presetId` and a `position`.

```json
"scenes": [
  {
    "id": "Level_1",
    "entities": [
      {
        "presetId": "player_character",
        "position": [0, 0]
      },
      {
        "presetId": "goomba",
        "position": [10, 0],
        "overridedVariables": {
          "f_moveSpeed": 2.0
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Overriding Variables
Optionally, an entity can include an `overridedVariables` object. Any variable defined here will override the default value from the original preset for that specific instance only.

---

## Behavior Tree (BT) Structure
The `behaviorTree` object defines an entity's actions and decisions using a nested structure of nodes.

Every node is an object with a `type` and a `name`.

Nodes that have children, like `Selector` and `Sequence`, must contain a `children` key with an array of node objects.

```json
"behaviorTree": {
  "type": "composite",
  "name": "Sequence",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "condition",
      "name": "CheckCollision",
      "direction": "Down",
      "targetTags": "Ground",
      "outputTarget": "{e_lastGroundCollision}"
    }
    {
      "type": "action",
      "name": "Jump",
      "jumpForce": "{f_jumpHeight}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding Comments to JSON
You can add comments to any node using the `"//"` key to explain the purpose or logic:

```json
{
  "type": "composite",
  "name": "Sequence",
  "//": "This sequence handles player movement logic",
  "children": [
    {
      "type": "action",
      "name": "Move",
      "//": "Move the player based on input",
      "direction": "{g_s_moveDirection}",
      "speed": "{f_moveSpeed}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Referencing Variables in Nodes
To use a value from an entity's variables block within a node's parameter, you MUST enclose the variable name in curly braces `{}`!!

You can freely use any variables, whether they are global variables starting with "g_" or entity-specific variables. There are no restrictions on which variables you can reference.

- Example: `"jumpForce": "{f_jumpHeight}"` will tell the Jump node to look for the `f_jumpHeight` variable in the entity's blackboard and use its value.

- Example: `"jumpForce": 10.0` uses a fixed, literal value.
